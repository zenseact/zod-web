# Annotations
On this page, we provide detailed information about the annotations that are included in our dataset. Our annotations are created by highly skilled human annotators using commercial labeling tools, and have undergone a rigorous quality control process to ensure their accuracy and consistency.

The annotation companies we work with are [Kognic](https://www.kognic.com/) and [Scale](https://www.scale.com/), both of which are renowned for their expertise in providing high-quality annotations for computer vision tasks.

We supply annotations for objects, lanes, traffic signs, driveable area, and road surface, all of which are described in detail below.
