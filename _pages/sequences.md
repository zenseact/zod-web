# ZOD Sequences

The ZOD Sequences dataset comprises `1473` high-quality, 20-second sequences with comprehensive sensor coverage. For an in-depth overview of the sensor configuration, please visit the [Sensor setup](/#sensor-setup) section on the [Home](/) page.

## Annotation Details

At present, the ZOD Sequences dataset is annotated only for a single keyframe, corresponding to the central camera frame within the sequence. These annotations strictly adhere to the Frames dataset style, encompassing annotations for `Objects`, `Lanes`, `Traffic Signs`, and `Ego Road`. For a thorough understanding of each annotation task, kindly refer to our [Annotation](/annotations) page.

We plan to release full-sequence annotations for some tasks in the near future, so stay tuned!

## Samples

Below, we showcase a selection of data samples from the dataset. These samples have been chosen to specifically highlight interesting and diverse traffic scenarios.
