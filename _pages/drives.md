# ZOD Drives

The ZOD Drives dataset consists of `29` multi-minute sequences, with full sensor coverage. For an in-depth coverage of the sensor configuration, please visit the [Sensor setup](/#sensor-setup) section on the [Home](/) page.

## Annotation

Currently, the ZOD Drives dataset does not include any annotations. Its primary purpose is to support localization and mapping tasks, rather than perception tasks.

## Data samples
Below, we showcase a selection of data samples from the dataset, providing an insight into the variety and quality of the sequences.
